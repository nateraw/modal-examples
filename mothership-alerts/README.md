This example texts me whenever new shows are added at the mothership comedy club in Austin, TX.

<!-- TODO - rewrite documentation here about setup, as we switched backed to Twilio

## Setup

To run this, you need to set up [secrets](https://modal.com/docs/guide/secrets). I called mine "textme", with the following:
  - GOOGLE_AUTH_PASSWORD: Created from: https://myaccount.google.com/apppasswords
  - GOOGLE_EMAIL: Your gmail: blah@gmail.com
  - PHONE_CARRIER: Your phone carrier: verizon, att, tmobile, etc.
  - PHONE_NUMBER: Your phone number: 5555555555

I would normally set the latter 3 as inputs to the script, as setting those as secrets feels a little janky. But given [my limited understanding of] how model cron jobs are deployed, I figured this was a OK pattern. Otherwise I'd have to hard code them in the script, which I'd rather not do when publishing to github. -->
